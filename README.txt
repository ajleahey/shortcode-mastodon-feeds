== Description ==
Display your Mastodon posts on a WordPress page. Simply add the [shortcode-mastodon-feeds] shortcode to any WordPress page where you want to display your Mastodon posts.

== Installation ==
Install from the Plugin store and Activate. Then look of two options added to the bottom of Admin's General Settings: one to enter a Mastodon profile URL and the other to declare how many posts should be pulled from the feed. Set these options and a feed will appear anywhere you place a [shortcode-mastodon-feeds] shortcode.
